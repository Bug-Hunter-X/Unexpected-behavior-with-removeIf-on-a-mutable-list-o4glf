This example demonstrates an uncommon error that can occur in Kotlin when using the `removeIf` function on a mutable list.  The `removeIf` function modifies the list in place which can lead to unexpected results if you assume it behaves like a filter that operates on a copy of the list.  The solution shows how to correctly achieve the desired behavior and avoid unexpected skips in the iteration.
